## Section 1: General
### Description
This document outlines the intake request for the development of the Contract Tool MVP in the Azure public cloud environment. The Contract Tool will provide a user-friendly interface for answering key questions related to pharma contracts, improving efficiency and accessibility to critical information. This initial MVP focuses on delivering core functionality while leveraging Azure services for scalability and cost-effectiveness.

### Business Segment Chief Architect Awareness
Business Segment Chief Architect: 

### User Details
*	Who are your users? Primarily internal OptumRx personnel with potential future expansion to include other Optum business units.
*	Are they internal (UHG Employees), external, or a mix of both? Initially internal, potentially expanding to other internal Optum business units in the future.
*	What is the expected activity (total population, Daily active Users, new users per month)? For the MVP phase, limited user base with projected [Insert Estimated Number] daily active users.
*	Describe how you are authenticating and authorizing users: Users will be authenticated via [Specify Authentication Method - e.g., Azure Active Directory]. Access control will be role-based with different permission levels for viewing, uploading, and managing contracts.

### Teams
Primarily, this application caters to teams within OptumRx responsible for
* Contract Management
*	Data Analytics
*	Business Operations

### Workload Placement use case

### Existing workload displacement & cost recovery
* Perceived amount of cost savings over time: Projected cost savings through increased efficiency in:
  * Contract retrieval and analysis
  * Reduction in manual data processing
  * Streamlined information sharing

### Summary
Leveraging the Azure cloud for the Contract Tool MVP offers a compelling solution due to its cost-effectiveness, scalability, and potential to streamline critical business processes within OptumRx.

### Alternatives
Developing and hosting the Contract Tool on-premises was considered. However, this approach would require significant upfront investment in hardware and software infrastructure, and it would lack the scalability and flexibility offered by the Azure cloud environment.
